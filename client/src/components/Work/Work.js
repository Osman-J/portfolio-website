    //TODO: find a better way to manage state for collapsible cards.
    /*  
        ISSUE: The issue is when we use 1 state for managing which
        icon to display (+ or -) when the state is changed
        all the cards icons change. */
    /* 
        Workaround: Instead of using 1 state, I created a state for each card.
        This isn't the ideal scenario but it is a temp fix. Using ref's may fix
        this issue or somehow calling a function which updates the state
        in the child component from the parent component may fix it.
